# Capstone_Project_SA_2025

I have selected one of the parking lots as the target lot which has implemented the model-2 pricing framework along with geographical insights based on model-3.
The other parking lots have their pricing model based on the model-1.
The pricing strategy for the target lot is influenced by its competitors, which are decided on the basis of geographical distance.
